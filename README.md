# TL-DR
A python program that will get recent and trending news articles from various sources and summarize their content. pyTL-DR will create a HTML page that will open in your browser, giving a nice, clean, interface to read the articles. A card will be generated and inserted into the HTML document for each article present and clicking the card will take you directly to the article's source.

# Credits
I am using [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and [SMMRY](https://smmry.com/) to get and summarize articles and [icons8](https://icons8.com/) for icons.
