# TL-DR
This is a python version of my TL-DR Android project. It will get recent and trending news articles from various sources and summarize their content. This is presented via a HTML page that opens in your browser, giving a nice, clean, interface to read the articles. 

# Credits
I am using NewsAPI and SMMRY to get and summarize articles. 

# Dependencies
requests library
pystache library
python-dateutil library
